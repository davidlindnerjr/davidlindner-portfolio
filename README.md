# David Lindner Web Development Portfolio [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Hello! This portfolio contains some of the best projects that I have developed throughout "The Stack". The portfolio itself was built using the React library in order to dynamically render the diffrent pages. You'll find out about my experience so far in web development and programming in general, along with my Resume, and links to different projects I have created/ co-created.
